# Loops

## Objectives

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `break` and `continue`

## For Loop

- used when you know how many times a code needs to run.
- run code for a specific number of times

```java
// Syntax
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

## WHile Loop

- used when unsure how many times a code needs to run.

```java
// Syntax
while (guess > choice) {
    guess = Math.random();
    System.out.println(guess);
}
```

## `break` and `continue`

- `continue`: skips a run, and continues to the next one.
- `break`: breaks the loop

## Nested Loop

- Has an outer and inner loop.
- useful when working with **2D arrays**.

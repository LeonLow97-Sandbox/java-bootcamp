# Inheritance

- Understand how inheritance favors code reuse.
- Define a parent class that serves a foundation for child classes.
- Every child class inherits field/methods from a parent class.

```java
// Parent class
public class Parent {}

// Child class
public class Chid1 extends Parent {}
public class Child2 extends Parent {}
```

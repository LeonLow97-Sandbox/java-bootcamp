# Printing Integers

Your task is to design a parallel algorithm to print all the integer values in a List.

Hint: we can split the array of integers into smaller sub-arrays until there are <2 items
left. We can use the sequential approach with these small sub-arrays.

There is not need to return any values so use `RecursiveAction`.
